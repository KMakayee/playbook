## LSP Setup (Code Navigation)

LSP gives Claude instant, accurate code navigation — definitions, references, type info, and diagnostics after edits.

**Setup (pick the language(s) your codebase uses):**

1. Install the language server binary (see table below)
2. Install the plugin: `/plugin install <name>@claude-plugins-official`
3. Restart Claude Code

**Supported languages:**

| Language   | Plugin                 | Binary to install                                  |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | `pyright-lsp`          | `pip install pyright`                               |
| TypeScript | `typescript-lsp`       | `npm install -g typescript-language-server`         |
| Go         | `gopls-lsp`            | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`       |

| C/C++      | `clangd-lsp`           | `clangd` (via LLVM)                                |
| C#         | `csharp-lsp`           | `dotnet tool install csharp-ls`                    |

**When to use what:**
- **LSP:** definitions, references, type info, diagnostics after edits
- **Grep/Glob:** discovery, finding files, searching patterns

---

## Pre-Edit Gate

**Before calling Edit or Write, classify the task:**

- **Trivial:** single file, under ~20 changed lines, no new abstractions, no changed interfaces → implement directly
- **Non-trivial:** 2+ files, OR new/changed abstractions, OR modified interfaces/contracts → **full QRSPI required**

If uncertain, it is non-trivial. Do not Edit/Write source files until the task is trivial OR the design is finalized and `plan.md` is approved.

**Bug fix mode:** Diagnose autonomously — don't ask the user to identify root cause. Non-trivial bug fixes still require full QRSPI.

---

## Phase 1: Research

1. Run `/research-codebase` with the task description — Codex sweeps, Claude synthesizes
2. Produces `tasks/research-codebase.md` — located paths, current behavior, design axes, risks
3. **Check context** — if above 30%, compact now

## Phase 2: Design

1. Run `/design` — Claude proposes options, Codex cross-checks, Claude picks the winner → `tasks/design-decision.md`
2. Pattern research runs inline via RUN/SKIP gate — produces `tasks/research-patterns.md` for novel/complex work
3. **Do not plan until design is finalized**

## Phase 3: Plan

1. Run `/create-plan` — Claude drafts, Codex reviews, Claude absorbs findings → `tasks/plan.md`
2. **Get human approval** — do NOT implement until plan is reviewed

> The plan creates **mental alignment** between you and the agent. Review the *intent*, not every line of generated code.

## Phase 4: Implement

1. Run `/implement` — executes the plan phase-by-phase, then runs Codex code review and applies triaged fixes via child process
2. **Follow the plan exactly** — deviations require a plan update first
3. **Change only what's specified** — no drive-by refactors or "improvements"
4. **Test after each step** — not just at the end
5. **Stop if surprised** — unexpected behavior → return to Research
6. **Commit per phase** — conventional commit messages
7. **Track progress** — checkboxes in `tasks/plan.md`
8. **One batch per prompt** — if the plan has independent batches, execute each in its own prompt (pre-edit gate applies per-batch)

## Compaction Triggers

| When                     | Action                                          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Context hits 30–35%      | Compact immediately                             |
| Research phase done      | Compact before Plan                             |
| Switching sub-problems   | Compact before pivoting                         |
| New conversation         | Start clean — never carry full prior context    |

---

## Quality Standards

- **Verify before completing** — prove it works (tests, logs, diff). Not "I think it works."
- **Find root causes** — no band-aids. Trace to source, fix the real problem.
- **Surgical changes** — every changed line needs a reason. Can't explain it? Revert it.
- **Demand elegance** — "Is there a simpler way?" (skip for mechanical fixes)
- **Self-assess** — "Would a staff engineer approve this?" If no, revise first.

---

## Red Flags

- Calling Edit/Write before classifying the task → pre-edit gate violation
- Skipping Research ("I already know this codebase") → slop
- Planning from memory instead of research-codebase.md → hallucinated structure
- Approving a plan you didn't read or think through → outsourced judgment
- Context window growing unchecked → entering the Dumb Zone
- Measuring PRs merged instead of rework rate → false productivity
- Completing a step without verifying it works → false progress
- Asking the user to diagnose a bug for you → wasted human attention

---

## Outcome Metrics

Track these to know if the workflow is actually helping:

- **Rework cycles** — how often is a change revisited within 2 weeks?
- **Slop rate** — what % of AI-generated code gets reverted or heavily rewritten?
- **Plan accuracy** — how often does implementation match the plan without deviations?
- **Time-to-merge** — for complex changes, not just simple ones
- **Correction repeat rate** — how often does the user give the same feedback twice?

---

## Starting a New Task

```
1. Fresh context window (or compact fully)
2. Define the task: input, output, success criteria
3. If non-trivial (see Pre-Edit Gate) → begin QRSPI
```

---

## Maintenance

Run `/playbook-update` to fetch the latest playbook version and apply updates interactively. Your project-specific CLAUDE.md customizations are preserved during updates.

Run `/playbook-audit` periodically to keep the playbook healthy.

**What it does:**
1. Compares each CLAUDE.md section against the actual codebase — flags stale or unconfigured sections
2. Cleans up leftover task artifacts (`research-codebase.md`, `design-decision.md`, `research-patterns.md`, `plan.md`)
3. Generates a health report in `tasks/audit-report.md`

**When to run it:**
- Every 2–4 weeks as routine maintenance
- After major refactors that change tech stack, directory structure, or conventions
- When Claude makes outdated assumptions about your codebase
